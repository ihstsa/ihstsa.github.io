IHSTSA is a small chapter of the Technology Student Association, an organization of over 200,000 students and advisors devoted to helping students explore STEM fields in over 60 annual competitive events. These events range in topic from website design, building catapults and small solar-powered cars, digital photography, to public speaking.

At the end of every year of preparation, we travel to the state and national TSA competitions. At Nationals, we compete against teams from all over the United States and often a few other countriesâ€”but we always bring home a pile of awards.
