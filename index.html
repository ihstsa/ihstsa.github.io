	<h3>Bringing students and <span id ='change'></span> together.</h3>
	<p>
		We are a club of students learning about STEM, with the goal of competing at the
		<a href="http://tsaweb.org/">Technology Student Association</a> state and national competition. We do lots of fun stuff like building catapults, coding video games, and creating amazing pictures (you use Photoshop)—and lots more!

<h3>About Us</h3>
It turns out that we're better at catapult building, fixing outer-space related problems with biotechnology, and debating uses of technology than a lot of people. Join us!

	<h3>Support Us</h3>
	<p>Our mission to attend the TSA National Conference requires funds that many of our members can't come up with.
	However, we want everyone to be able to compete, and we'd any support towards that end—any amount helps.
	Would you please make a tax-deductible donation so all of us attend the conference? <a href="support.html#eventname">Donate here!</a></p>
